# UniLab

Languages: English | [简体中文](docs/zh_CN/01-getting-started.md)

Train robot RL without a GPU simulation backend.

UniLab uses **CPU simulation + shared-memory runtime + GPU learning** instead of coupling simulation and learning inside one GPU-resident pipeline.

Start with the `Quick Demo` below to run the first documented training command from this repository.

## Quick Demo

```bash
# 0. If uv is not installed
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/unilabsim/UniLab.git
cd UniLab

# 2. Install dependencies
uv sync --extra motrix

# 3. Run a first PPO training job on macOS / MacBook
# macOS: (73s on M5Max-128GB, 1min43s on M3Max-48GB, 2.5min on MacBookNeo-8GB)
uv run mxpython scripts/train_rsl_rl.py task=go2_joystick/motrix

# 4. Run the same training job on Linux
# Linux: PPO (31s on RTX 4090 and R9-9950x3d)
uv run scripts/train_rsl_rl.py task=go2_joystick/motrix
```

This is the shortest repository entrypoint today. It uses the PPO training script on the registered `go2_joystick/motrix` task and gives a direct first-success path before you learn the full workflow.

On macOS / MacBook, commands that open the MotrixSim native renderer must be launched with `uv run mxpython` instead of `uv run python`. Plain non-rendering training can still use `uv run python ... training.no_play=true`.

## Example Runs

These are example repository runs for documented commands and hardware setups. They are useful as concrete entrypoints and reported timings, but they are **not** yet a formal benchmark manifest.

```bash
# Linux SAC (5.5min on RTX 4090 and R9-9950x3d)
uv run scripts/train_offpolicy.py algo=sac task=sac/g1_sac/motrix
```

```bash
# Linux G1 motion tracking (1h35min on RTX 4090 and R9-9950x3d)
uv run scripts/train_rsl_rl.py task=g1_motion_tracking/mujoco
```

## Workflow Entrypoints

| Goal | Entrypoint | Log root pattern |
|------|------------|------------------|
| PPO (torch / RSL-RL) | `scripts/train_rsl_rl.py` | `logs/rsl_rl_ppo/<task>/` |
| PPO (MLX, macOS) | `scripts/train_mlx_ppo.py` | `logs/rsl_rl_ppo/<task>/` |
| APPO | `scripts/train_appo.py` | `logs/appo/<task>/` |
| SAC | `scripts/train_offpolicy.py` | `logs/fast_sac/<task>/` |
| TD3 | `scripts/train_offpolicy.py` | `logs/fast_td3/<task>/` |

Training scripts automatically enter playback after training unless you set `training.no_play=true`.

For MotrixSim visualization or `training.play_only=true` on macOS / MacBook, reuse the macOS renderer rule from `Quick Demo` and see `docs/zh_CN/03-training.md`.
